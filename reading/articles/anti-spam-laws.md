> sections of the much maligned Information Technology (IT) Act could be
> helpful here.

> For one, under section 79 of the Act, Internet intermediaries must
> take care and diligence with regard to the services they provide,
> which read together with section 43A of the Act (compensation for
> failure to protect personal data from theft), can "indirectly bring
> into play a data privacy law", explains Waris.

> But there is no specific law that would obligate them or would impose
> a penalty on companies that started sending out spam. Several drafts
> of full-fledged Indian data protection Acts have languished without
> ever passing into law, though of course significant progress has been
> made by the department of telecommunications with telephone “do not
> disturb” registers and SMS spam curbs.

> For example, Waris posits that under Section 66A of the IT Act, if
> interpreted generously, there could be some action against ruthless
> email spammers who do not leave you alone with their clients’ sales
> messages.

> Section 66A, of course, came into recent national infamy after the
> death of Bal Thackeray and the arrest of two young women who had
> posted allegedly offensive messages about the subsequent Mumbai
> shutdown on Facebook. Well, if their messages were offensive, then it
> might just be possible to argue that spam is, too.
