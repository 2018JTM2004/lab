This directory contains a minimal working example that demonstrates the
the idea discussed in [*Interactive Programming in
C*](http://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/12/23/) by Chris Wellons.

Here are the steps to run the example.

  1. In a terminal, run `make`, then `./main`.
  2. Edit `work.c` to change the output.
  3. In a second terminal, run `make work.so`. The changes are reflected
     in the first terminal running the program.

The example in this directory has been verified using gcc 4.9.2 on
Debian 8.3.
